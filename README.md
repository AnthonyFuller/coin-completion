# Coin Completion

Have you ever wanted to complete your Freelancer Tools collection? Well now you can!

This mod adds the Outstanding Service Coin to the Supplier and Supply Crate pool.
It also fixes the rotation of the coin in the case, just so it is consistent.

Works on official, but there's a caveat:

-   Price on official: 50 M
-   Price on Peacock: 5000 M

Price on Peacock has been adjusted with the "inflation" IOI did, it will work on official too if you disable dynamic resources.
This mod **does not** disable it for you as I don't really see a need to do that.

**Installation Instruction**

1. Make sure the Simple Mod Framework is installed, you can find [it here](https://www.nexusmods.com/hitman3/mods/200/).
2. Download the zip from the Files tab and open the Mod Manager GUI, use the **Add a Mod** button and select the zip you just downloaded.
3. Press **Apply** and enjoy your coin.
